Xinchejian Swarm Robot project

This folder is for the custom PCB ATMEGA328 SwarmRobot version.


Folder structure:

	/eagle 		kicad schematics and PCB design files
	/source		source code

	Note there is a LARGE amount of direct compatability between the code for ALL versions. Differences to note are:
		- different IO pins - see "Arduino, AtTiny, L293 and header pin mappings.ods"
		- size of memory limits size of code
		- AtTiny versions have fewer IO commands available. See http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Programming-AFRON
