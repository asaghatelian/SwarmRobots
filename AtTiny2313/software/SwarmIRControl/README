C-code targeted to the ATiny2313 to receive and decode data from infrared 
remote controls using the Philips RC5 protocol. Based on Atmel's AVR410 
application note (which included code written in AVR assembler).

Requires external 4MHz crystal with 12-22pF capacitors to ground.

Pins in use:
------------
PD6       (11) = input from remote control receiver/demodulator
PD1/TXD   ( 3) = detected codes are written as serial at 9600 bits per second.
PA1/XTAL2 ( 4) = crystal 
PA0/XTAL1 ( 5) = crystal 
PD2/CKOUT ( 6) = system clock (4MHz) output, if fuse set
