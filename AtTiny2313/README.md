xcj_swarm/AtTiny2313
=========

Part of Xinchejian Swarm Robot project - contains ALL software and hardware for AtTiny2313 SwarmRobots.

As there are now many different types of SwarmRobots, moving all AtTiny2313 files here.


/software/SwarmIRControl		SwarmRobot(s) respond to RC5 IR comamnds
					Build from command line 'make' - so you need a compiler setup!
/software/SwarmIRControllerArduino	Send RC5 commands to SwarmRobot(s) using an Arduino 
						(most remotes in China are NEC protocol!)


... to do 
	- add non-rc5 ie any IR follow to SwarmIRControl
	- move all AtTiny software & hardware files from root of this repo here.
	- more doco on compiling & settting up compiler....
		(if you have Arduino instaled - you should have it already, maybe need path..)
