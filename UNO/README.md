Xinchejian Swarm Robot project

This folder is for the Arduino UNO based SwarmRobot version.

Folder structure:

	/kicad 		kicad schematics and PCB design files
	/eagle 		eagle schematics and PCB design files
	/source		source code

	/ATMEGA328	version based on 
	/UNO		version built onto and existing Arduino UNO.

	Note there is a LARGE amount of direct compatability between the code for ALL versions. Differences to note are:
		- different IO pins - see "Arduino, AtTiny, L293 and header pin mappings.ods"
		- size of memory limits size of code
		- AtTiny versions have fewer IO commands available. See http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Programming-AFRON
