Xinchejian Swarm Robot project

Introduction:

Build a swarm of robots with autonomus behavior to achieve their goals by interacting with each other using IR communication.

Each robot will have a basic programming and basic hardware platform. 
The basic programming is:

1. Self protection: 
	- check your battery status
	- find the charging station when battery runs low
	- avoid obstacles and other robots
	- search for power (sunlight etc.)
2. Community (swarm) needs:
	- search for building material
	- search for dead robots
	- bring dead robots to the charging station
	- help dead robots with a charger robot
	- tell others where to find power (sunlight)
	- tell others where is an obstacle or danger

Will be updated...
